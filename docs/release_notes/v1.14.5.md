## Fix content type metadata from query for outbox transaction

### Problem

Transactions were not respecting the metadata in the transaction request.
For example, content type specified in the metadata was not being applied and the message was being sent as plain text.

### Impact

Outbox transactions were not respecting the metadata. 
Cloudevents data was being sent as plain text and Cloudevents Middleware was not able to parse the data resulting in 415 error code.

### Root cause

Metadata in the request was not being applied to the transaction.

### Solution

Read the metadata from the request and apply them to the transaction.
